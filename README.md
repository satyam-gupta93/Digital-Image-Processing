# 🖼️ Digital Image Processing Lab

Welcome to my Digital Image Processing Lab repository!  
This project contains all the practical tasks and assignments completed as part of the **DIP course** using **Python**, **OpenCV**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**.

The purpose of this lab work is to apply core image processing techniques like grayscale conversion, RGB plane extraction, thresholding, histogram equalization, filtering, edge detection, and more.

Each lab folder contains a self-contained Python script with appropriate comments and documentation.
