# Lab 4: Image Compression using Arithmetic Coding and JPEG  

---

## Aim
To study and implement two fundamental image compression techniques:  

1. Lossless Compression using **Arithmetic Coding**.  
2. Lossy Compression using the **JPEG method** with **Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)**.

## Introduction
Image compression reduces the number of bits required to represent an image by eliminating redundancy while preserving visual information.  

### Lossless Compression (Arithmetic Coding)
- Reconstructs the image exactly.  
- Uses entropy encoding to map a sequence of symbols into a fractional number between 0 and 1.  

### Lossy Compression (JPEG)
- Achieves higher compression ratios by discarding less important information.  
- Uses DCT to transform blocks into the frequency domain and quantization to remove high-frequency data.
